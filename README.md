**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for anyone looking for a practical approach to learning GitHub Actions, regardless of their experience level. Whether you're a software developer, a DevOps engineer, anyone who has already experimented with Actions, or someone completely new to CI/CD tools like Jenkins or Azure Pipelines, you’ll find expert insights in this book. Basic knowledge of using Git and command lines is a must.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-7).
### Software and Hardware List
 | Software/hardware covered in the book | OS requirements |
 | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
 | GitHub | All operating systems are compatible. You will need an account on https://github.com. |
 | Visual Studio Code | All operating systems are compatible. If you want, you can use GitHub Codespaces for all recipes. In this case, you don’t have to install anything locally. If you want to work locally, then you’ll need Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the subsequent tools. |
 | Git | Only required if you work locally. All operating systems are compatible. You should have an up-to-date version of Git installed (at least version 2.23). |
 | GitHub CLI | Only required if you work locally. Install the GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com/). |
 | Node.js | Only required if you work locally. You’ll need an up-to-date version of Node.js (I’m using 21 at the time of writing). All operating systems are compatible. Download the latest version here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current. |
 | Docker | Only required if you work locally. Get Docker for all operating systems here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/. |
 | Azure and the Azure CLI | For some chapters, you’ll need an Azure account and the Azure CLI. A free test version will be sufficient (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free). If you want to work locally, you’ll also need the Azure CLI. |
